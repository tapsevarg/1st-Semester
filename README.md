# CIS 106 - Patrick Graves

I am taking this class so I can eventually pursue a computer focused graduate degree. I plan to earn a Software Development certificate first. I'm hoping this provides better financial outcomes and job security. I assume I'll be learning Python 3, because that is the default suggestion. I'm not sure yet what I will do with Pyhton skills, but using it for work is the main idea.
