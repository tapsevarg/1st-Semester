# CIS106

My name is Patrick Graves. I am taking this class so I can pursue a computer focused graduate degree. I have a B.A. in Communications - Media. So I have to go back and take some foundational computer classes before I can embark upon that journey. In the process, I am planning to earn a Software Development certificate. I'm hoping this provides better financial outcomes and job security. I assume I'll be learning Python 3, though I will try to learn as much as I can. I am just excited to be learning new skills.
