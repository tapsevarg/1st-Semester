# CIS 106 - Patrick Graves
Assignment 1: I am taking this class so I can eventually pursue a computer focused graduate degree. I plan to earn a Software Development certificate first. I'm hoping this provides better financial outcomes and job security. I assume I'll be learning Python 3, because that is the default suggestion. I'm not sure yet what I will do with Pyhton skills, but using it for work is the main idea.

Assignment 2: I learned a bit about the fundamentals of coding. I saw how Github displays commit changes in revisions. While using Repl.it and Pythontutor, I executed code created through via a Flowgorithm flowchart. I got a better sense of correct code from Pythontutor, as it gave me a very clear output. This is a very early step in learning to code. I hope it helps me in some way shape or form in my career.
